# build-me-a-kali

***Build me a Kali worthy of Mordor***

This project is designed to turn a fresh instance of Kali Linux into a machine 
that I can use for hacking / training / CTFs.

## How to use

It should work out-of-the box on Kali Linux, and configure the machine just 
the way I'd like it.

To use it, simply do the following:

```
perl ./build-me-a-kali.pl
```
